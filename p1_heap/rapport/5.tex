  \subsubsection*{Graphs with many \textit{decrease key} operations} 
    Constructing a graph with many \textit{decrease key} operations is fairly easy. The problem is making sure the \textit{decrease key} operation force the Binary Heap to move the element. If the element after the \textit{decrease key} doesn't violate the Binary Heap property, it does not need to be moved and will be a constant operation, and thus it will match the Fibonacci Heap.
