\section*{Comparison with Red-Black Trees}
Kort om red-black trees
hvilke test cases har vi og hvorfor?

In order to compare Red-Black trees to van Emde Boas trees we constructed a simple sorting benchmark.
To do that we implemented a list generator, whose product should be sorted by either algorithm.
The generator produces a list of random numbers from 0 to a given maximum and terminates once a given size is reached.
