\section*{Primitive Priority Queue}
To test for correctness and to have some ``stupid'' reference, we implemented a very primitive queue. This queue is a linked list. \em{Initialize}, \em{insert} and \em{decrease_key} are all constant operations. The \em{find_min} and \em{delete_min} operations scan the entire list and, in case of \em{find_min}, returns the minimum element, a $O(n)$ operation.
