\section*{Primitive Priority Queue}
To test for correctness and to have some ``stupid'' reference, we implemented a very primitive queue. This queue is a linked list, and initializing, inserting, deleting and decrease key are all constant operations. The find min operation scan the entire list and return the minimum element, a $O(n)$ operation.
