\section*{Project}
In this project we perform an experimental study of functional data structures. The implementations are done in Haskell, which is a lazy language. Due to this we have to make sure that our results are actually used, so the evaluations are not postponed.

We implement a queue using
\begin{enumerate}
 \item A standard Haskell list.
 \item A pair of lists, with amotized $O(1)$ guarantee if the same queue will never be argument to repeated queue operations.
 \item A pair of lists, exploiting the properties of lazy evaluation of list concatenation to guranteed amortized $O(1)$ per queue operation.
 \item A $O(1)$ list, with a worst-case gurantee of $O(1)$ per queue operation (if executed strictly).
\end{enumerate}

We then design and perform experiements comparing the different implementations, where we cover the worst-case scenario for every queue
